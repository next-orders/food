## üçï Main idea and architecture of Next-Orders

There is a great desire to create software that is ideal for ordering and delivering food.
It will be a set of solutions that can work together. It is important that each element can be easily replaced later.
So the project does not become one big monolith.

I'm currently working on first version of the website. Next year there will be a new version that will easily replace the old one as the Main API with business logic will remain the same.

Let's see what happens. Give the project a star ‚≠ê. Offer your ideas and make commits.
